# Boolean in SESS

## Overview

## Algorithm
First,we should know that because of there's no base-axis in reality,the origin coordinate of the optics is the bone origin and 
will be changed after every calibration.

![No Axis](https://pic4rain.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/No%20Base%20Axis.png)

Thus,the bone origin is a standard coordinate.

However,because of the *Mechanical Assembly Error* and *Optics Error*,in a specific frame,we can't guarantee the
bone is at origin(0,0,0),we should record this transformation **T1**`Matrix4x4`.

So,when should we record this transformation?

*Record this per frame in Update until the angle variation of bone is exceed 5 degree*

*If during recording,the optics is covered by something,keep the last data*

**Ensure that the software is started in a prone position**

When do boolean,record the current transform and get a transform between current and reference,called **T2**`Matrix4x4`.

*No distinction is made between prone and lateral positions*

Then,do boolean.We can get the current transform of the trePan in Unity coordinate.This transform is called **T3**`Matrix4x4`.

In this case,we could do C# boolean.

When do C++ Boolean,the bone.obj from IO we call it **bone**,we do transform **T1** and **T2** to it.

```c++
bone.vertices[i] = T1.MultiplyPoint(bone.vertices[i]);
bone.vertices[i] = T2.MultiplyPoint(bone.vertices[i]);
```
and we do **T3** to trepan.obj from IO which we call **trepan**

```c++
trepan.vertices[i] = T3.MultiplyPoint(trepan.vertices[i]);
```

Finally,do C++ boolean.


In the same way,we can get the BoolCenter and Pivot in Unity Coordinate.

![](https://pic4rain.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/Pivot.png)

```c++
var currentMatrix = Pivot.localToWorldMatrix;
currentMatrix = Matrix4x4.Inverse(T1) * currentMatrix;
var t2Translation = T2.GetColumn(3);
currentMatrix = Matrix4x4.Translate(-t2Translation) * currentMatrix;

Pivot.position = currentMatrix.GetColumn(3);
Pivot.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(currentMatrix.GetColumn(2), currentMatrix.GetColumn(1));
```

This pivot is the pivot which needed in flex with getting rid of **T1** and **T2**'s translate.

And at this point,we pass the T2.rotation to Flex using `IO` or `shared memory`,at present,we pass this value using euler angles.

In Unity endoscope scene,we have been passed the `mesh` from boolean scene,and give a T2.rotation and a fixed translation (0,1,0) because of flex.

So far, we have dealt with C# and C++ booleans, and have done a good job of alignment and passing.

**But**

Since the three scenes of boolean, endoscope and physics respectively adopted 3 different sets of models during modeling, we also need to deal with the offset between the models.

**Although**

The motion trajectory are two Irregular arcs,we also could represent it with a transform of matrix4x4,so it could be decomposed
 with a rotation and a position.

We assume that the object moves along only one arc.

Next, get rid of the translation part of **T2**, that is, align the axis to the original axis

![](https://pic4rain.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/Rot.png)

and,the vertices and triangles are similar but not the same .

![](https://pic4rain.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/model.png)

but,the offset between two models is const,i.e.,the T2's translation is const,only the rotation is different.

we prepare the `A` and `B` 's transform,and we can get the `A'` and `B'` 's transform,so we can get the runtime transform **T4**,

```c++
var rotationMatrix = Matrix4x4.Rotate(T2.rotation);
var resultTransform = rotationMatrix.MultiplyPoint(origin);
T4 = Matrix4x4.Translate(resultTransform)*T2.localToWorldMatrix;
```
